# Bot-Runeterra
Discord bot that checks the user last game and sends the decklist of their opponent.

Install dependencies with npm install.

The cardlist has to be in the cardlist folder. Download every archive from Riot's website (https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lor) and unzip everything in that folder. (Also don't forget to download data from the 5th set, the website wasn't updated yet and apparently the lite version is missing cards. https://dd.b.pvp.net/latest/set5-en_us.zip )
